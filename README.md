Very big and complex project.

Idea: Build a robotic arm which could play chess autonomously by using an interface to the stockfish engine.
Overall, the project was a success, the chess arm worked and performed very well. Used elements of Peter Corke's matlab toolbox for inverse kinematics, and a self-made Computer Vision algorithm to detect chess pieces on a physical board using an Intel RealSense Depth camera. 

One of my favorite projects to date!
